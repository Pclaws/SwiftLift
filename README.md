# SwiftLift


SwiftLift is a basic web application designed for a transportation and moving company. This project was created as part of my journey learning Bootstrap and modern web development practices.

The app features a responsive layout built with Bootstrap 5, including a navigation bar, feature highlights, an image carousel, and a footer with newsletter signup. The design demonstrates how Bootstrap components can be combined to quickly build a professional-looking landing page for a service-based business.

**Key Features:**
- Responsive navigation bar with dropdowns
- Hero section with gradient text and call-to-action buttons
- Feature section highlighting company strengths
- Image carousel for testimonials or service highlights
- Footer with useful links and newsletter subscription form

This project is intended for educational purposes and as a starting point for anyone looking to build a simple, attractive website for a transportation or moving company using Bootstrap.
